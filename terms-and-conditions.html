Failure to comply with these Terms and Conditions may result in non-provision of services at the discretion of Airoam.</p>
                    <p>If you book services on behalf of additional guests, you are required to ensure that every additional guest meets any requirements as set by Airoam, and is made aware of and agrees to these Terms and any terms and conditions, rules and restrictions set by Airoam.</p>
                    <p>All guests agree that any property will be left in the same clean, neat and tidy condition as it was when they arrived.</p>

                    <h3>Security deposit</h3>
                    <p>Guests are required to provide a minimum of AUD 300 security bond (in the form of a credit card pre-authorisation) that will be held as guarantee on the apartment and incidental charges.</p>
                    <p>The security bond will be released in full to the guest as soon as practicable after the guest's departure, conditional on satisfactory property inspection and incidental charges.</p>
                    <p>In the event the condition is not satisfactory, the security bond will be held pending resolution of the matter. The security bond payment may be used to cover incidental items such as (but not limited to):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Extra guests not included in the booking</li>
                        <li>Any breakages or damages incurred during the stay</li>

                        <li>Replacement keys/passes</li>
                        <li>Emergency call-out fees or cleaning charges in excess of the normal levels of cleaning</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Damages and security</h3>
                    <p>Guests are liable to pay for any missing property or damage to the property, furniture or fittings on the premises caused by themselves or their visitors. Guests must report any damage or repairs immediately to Airoam. This includes, but is not limited to, all and any damage caused to areas including the apartment, and common areas including any recreational facilities, gardens, lounges and car parking facilities within the building premises.</p>
                    <p>All fixtures, fittings, furniture and appliances are assumed to be in good working order at the commencement of your stay, and in the event that any item is not in good working order at the commencement of your stay, you must notify us immediately, so that the condition of the item can be recorded at that time. If we have not received notification from you, any damage will be deemed to have been caused by you.</p>
                    <p>Airoam reserves the right to collect payment from you and pursue any remedies available to Airoam in situations in which you are responsible for any damage/missing property should the loss suffered by Airoam exceed the security bond.</p>
                    <p>It is the responsibility of all guests to securely lock the accommodation.</p>
                    <p>Smoking is strictly prohibited on premises, including inside the accommodation and on the balconies. An additional cleaning charge of AUD 300 will apply if traces of smoking in the apartment are found.</p>
                    <p>Guests are encouraged to immediately notify Airoam of any suspicious, illegal activity or misdemeanour seen or witnessed, including any damage or loss, whether major or minor, within the building premises.</p>
                    <p>Guests are required to keep all recreational facilities (if available) clean and tidy after use, and agree to adhere to all rules and regulations enforced by any administrators of the facilities.</p>
                    <p>Guests must, at all times, observe the rules governing use of common amenities areas within the building premises. These rules can be found on signage located on the amenities floor and are to be adhered to in conjunction with the rules of the Owners Corporation. These areas are not recommended for use by children without adult supervision. Please observe all safety signage and instructions.</p>
                    <p>Guests are liable to pay for any fire brigade call out fees due to guest negligence (e.g. smoking in the apartment, burnt cooking, etc.).</p>
